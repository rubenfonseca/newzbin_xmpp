h1. newzbin_xmpp

newzbin_xmpp is a XMPP agent that allows registered users to search on the
"newzbin":http://www.newzbin.com website.

h2. features

* admin controllable ACL-like system (only the users you approve can use the system) 
* everything you say to the agent, it will search on newzbin

h2. requirements

* Ruby (only tested with 1.8)
* XMPP4R (http://home.gna.org/xmpp4r/)
* CouchDB database (http://couchdb.apache.org/)
* daemons gem

h2. notes

if some of the code doesn't make any sense, then it's because it doesn't. this was just
a test of the XMPP4R gem, and I decided to build something useful to me and my friends.

it's probably incomplete and buggy, but it's in a state that works for me

h2. instructions

* checkout the code from github
* setup a couchdb database
* copy @config.yml.template@ to @config.yml@ and edit the values accordingly
* execute @bot.rb@ directly or @bot_control.rb@ if you want daemon behavior

since it's buggy, it's recommended you run @bot_control.rb@ under some kind of process
monitor like @monit@ or @god@

h2. final thoughts

feel free to comment on the code or send me suggestions on how to improve it. any feedback
will be appreciated. remember, this is my first attempt with XMPP4R
